			<h2>A simple language for creating complex neural networks</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			<strong>DeepLearning.scala</strong> is a domain-specific language embedded in <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, for creating complex neural networks.
			With the help of DeepLearning.scala, regular programmers are able to build complex neural networks from simple code.
			You write code almost as usual. The only difference is that code based on DeepLearning.scala is <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable</a>,
			able to evolve itself by modifying its parameters continuously.

					DeepLearning.scala allows you to build neural networks from mathematical formulas.
					It supports <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.deeplearning/unidoc_2.11/latest/com/thoughtworks/deeplearning/DifferentiableFloat$.html">float</a>s,
					<a href="https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.deeplearning/unidoc_2.11/latest/com/thoughtworks/deeplearning/DifferentiableDouble$.html">double</a>s,

				<p style="text-align: justify">
					DeepLearning.scala supports differentiable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">ADT</a> data structures (e.g. <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.deeplearning/unidoc_2.11/latest/com/thoughtworks/deeplearning/DifferentiableHList$.html">HList</a> and <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.deeplearning/unidoc_2.11/latest/com/thoughtworks/deeplearning/DifferentiableCoproduct$.html">Coproduct</a>) and differentiable control flow.
					You can implement arbitary Turing-complete algorithms inside neural networks, and still keep some of the variables used in the algorithms differentiable and trainable.

				<h3 style="white-space: nowrap">Composibility</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify">
					Neural networks created by DeepLearning.scala are composable.
					You can create complex networks by combining smaller networks, or even sharing sub-networks between different networks, taking advantage of Transfer Learning.

				<h3 style="white-space: nowrap">Static Type System</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify">
					Neural networks created by DeepLearning.scala are statically type checked, and have their own API signatures, making them reuseable in a larger system maintained by a big team.
